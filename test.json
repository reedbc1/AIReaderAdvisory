`status.controllerOf`.\r\n\r\nSteps to verify:\r\n\r\n1. Checkout a version PKO from before the bug was introduced (e.g `8af6f451fbc84919f77f7a66fc1f14673d1cd097`)\r\n2. Deploy using the self-bootstrap-local job.\r\n3. Create and object template.\r\n4. Verify that is has no `version` in the  `.status.controllerOf` object.\r\n5. Check this branch\r\n6. Apply the self-bootstrap-local job to upgrade PKO\r\n7. Verify that after reconciling `version` is added to the object templates `.status.controllerOf` field. \r\n\r\n### Change Type\r\n\r\n<!-- Uncomment one of the following -->\r\n<!-- Breaking Change
