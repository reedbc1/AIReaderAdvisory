Dolly Parton, Tom Everett Scott, Angel Parker, Mary Lane Haskell, Ana Gasteyer, Jimmy Fallon, Willie Nelson, Billy Ray Cyrus, Jimmie Allen, Zach Williams, Miley Cyrus. A modern-day movie musical about the making of a network TV special, Dolly Parton's Mountain Magic Christmas is the frenetic backstage story and on-camera results of Dolly's desire to uplift an exhausted world's spirits by sharing the unique \"mountain magic\" she has always found in and around Dollywood at Christmas. Throughout the movie's production numbers and rehearsal chaos, Dolly finds herself taking a private journey into her past, guided by the mysterious appearances of her personal Three Wise Men. When it's time for her big special to air live, a renewed and inspired Dolly goes rogue and shows the world that the real magic of Christmas lies in the hearts of the children we all once were, the realization that Christmas is about the people we share it with, and how her faith remains the common thread between Christmases past, present, and future.

Music, Stephanie Economou. Voices: Lana Condor, Toni Collette, Annie Murphy, Colman Domingo, Jane Fonda. Sweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. She's math-tutoring her skater-boy crush, who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she's prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom has forbidden Ruby from ever getting in the water. But when she breaks her mom's #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother, the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. The Kraken is sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There's one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school's beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea, just happens to be a mermaid.

Whatever Fred needs, his new best friend, a shape-changing robot named Friday can turn himself into. But Friday was not supposed to be a gift from the sky, he was supposed to belong to Fred's neighbor, secret Agent Brains, who works for the intergalactic safety organization called The Protectors. Brains disguises herself as a regular awkward girl named Braianna, while saving the world from alien invasions, escaped bug populations, Sewer Bears, and other mysteries. It sure would be easier if she had her robot, but now he only answers Fred's voice commands. Together, Brains, Fred and Friday work as a team taking on the challenges of alien invaders, and worse-- junior high! Not rated. DVD. In English.",

But Jack alone is no match for the hordes of Zombies and Winged Wretches and Vine Thingies, and especially not for the eerily intelligent monster known only as Blarg. So, Jack builds a team: his dorky best friend, Quint; the reformed middle school bully, Dirk; Jack's loyal pet monster, Rover; and Jack's crush, June.

Originally broadcast as a 4-part television mini-series on PBS and BBC in 2025. Based on Gill Hornby's best-selling novel, Miss Austen takes a literary mystery - Cassandra Austen notoriously burning her famous sister Jane's letters - and reimagines it as a fascinating, witty and heartbreaking story of sisterly love. The drama begins in 1830, several years after Jane has died. Cassandra races to see her friend Isabella, who is about to lose her home following her father's death. Cassandra is ostensibly there to help, but her real motive is to find a stash of private letters which, in the wrong hands, could destroy Jane's reputation. Not rated.

            "notes": "Instant title available through hoopla. Directed by Alex Schaad. Jonas Dassler, Mala Emde, Thomas Wodianka, Maryam Zaree. Seeking a retreat where they can salvage their struggling relationship, young couple Leyla (Mala Emde) and Tristan (Jonas Dassler) travel to a remote island at the invitation of Leyla's childhood friend Stella, where it soon becomes clear that what the island offers is more mysterious than a simple vacation. Leyla and Tristan join another couple in a ritual to exchange bodies and see the world through the eyes of someone else - a chance to find themselves or, for some of them, a chance at escape. Free from the constraints of her former body, Leyla quickly finds she has never been happier, with a fresh outlook on life and a new sense of release and fulfillment. But when she refuses to return to her old self, the situation threatens to spiral out of control. Subverting genre and gender as it toggles from body swap thriller to intimate relationship drama, Skin Deep tells a story that transcends bodies, embracing the endless fluid possibilities in the question of what it means to truly love someone. Winner of the Queer Lion at the Venice Film Festival and directed by Student Academy Award\u00ae winner Alex Schaad. Not rated. Mode of access: World Wide Web.",

Created by Julian Unthank. Julie Graham, Siobhan Redmond, Sarah Woodward, Florence Hall, Juliet Stevenson. In the picturesque English region of Wildemarsh, Detective Matilda Stone investigates crimes with the aid or, often, meddling of her three mystery-writing aunts, who raised her from childhood. Together, they look into a murder at a health spa, a killing in the contemporary art world, and the theft of an Edgar Allen Poe manuscript. Matilda has decidedly less success with her personal affairs, continuing to pine for Dr. Daniel Lynch even as she begins a new romance. But while Matilda's love life hits a snag, she makes headway in the case of her mother's long-ago disappearance despite her aunts' best efforts to conceal the secret she most wants to know.

Set in 1967, a heartwarming film that follows the story of three generations of close friends, Lily, Eileen, and Dolly of Ballygar, a hard-knocks community in Dublin, who have one tantalizing dream: to win a pilgrimage to the sacred French town of Lourdes, that place of miracles that draws millions of visitors each year. When the chance to win presents itself, the women seize it. However, just before their trip, their old friend Chrissie arrives in Ballygar for her mother's funeral, dampening their good mood and well-laid plans. The women secure tickets and set out on the journey that they hope will change their lives, with Chrissie, a skeptical traveler, joining in place of her mother. The glamor and sophistication of Chrissie, who has just returned from a nearly 40-year exile in the United States, are not her only distancing traits: Old wounds are reopened along the way, forcing the women to confront their pasts even as they travel in search of a miracle. Their shared traumas can only be healed by the curative power of love and friendship. MPAA rating: PG-13; thematic elements and some language. English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing (SDH). DVD, Dolby digital, Dolby surround., DVD, region 1, anamorphic widescreen, English, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.

After a fatal car crash on a rural road claims the life of Aymeric, his handsome family estate is left to his equally handsome and grief-stricken husband, the renowned Parisian author Manuel. Manuel is shocked not only by his husband's death, but also by the fact that he was the son of a wealthy landowner - something Aymeric kept secret from him. Aymeric was supposed to have been on a business trip to Brussels. What was he doing on a country road in France? The pieces don't add up. Could Aymeric's death be due to something more than a simple accident? As Manuel arrives in Aix-en-Provence to claim his inheritance, he is immediately shut out by Aymeric's less-than-sympathetic family, who expect to continue their role in running the vast estate. The immediate and seething animosity becomes even more heated as Manuel vocalizes his suspicions of foul play. But he finds an ally in the form of recently-retired policeman Richard Saugier, who helps him investigate Aymeric's death and the secrets of his powerful family - secrets that some would prefer remain buried forever.

Based on a true story, Bessie and Josephine are sisters employed at American Radium, where they paint glow-in-the-dark watch dials at a New Jersey factory. They take pride in their jobs and Bessie dreams of becoming an actress in the new motion picture industry and having crowds of adoring fans. However, when her younger sister Josephine becomes ill, the sisters uncover the unknown truth about radium: it's a deadly poison. With Jo's life dwindling, just as those of her former colleagues have, Bessie becomes determined to bring the horrors of radium poisoning to light and take down American Radium and fights not only for her sister, but also for the rest of the women around her; she becomes a powerful advocate as she risks everything to stand up to the corporation that provides her family's livelihood. Starring Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Joey King (\"The Act,\", \"The Kissing Booth\") and Abby Quinn (\"Mad About You\" reboot, \"Little Women\"), Radium Girls is a celebration of everyday women finding their strength in the unlikeliest of circumstances.

This vibrant and inventive father-daughter comedy follows Georgie (Lola Campbell), a resourceful 12-year-old who secretly lives alone in her flat in a working class suburb of London following the death of her beloved mum. She makes money stealing bikes with her best friend Ali (Alin Uzun) and keeps the social workers off her back by pretending to live with an uncle. But when her estranged father Jason (Harris Dickinson; Triangle of Sadness, Beach Rats) turns up out of the blue, she's forced to confront reality. Uninterested in this sudden new parental figure, Georgie is stubbornly resistant to Jason's efforts and they quickly find that they both still have a lot of growing up to do. Dickinson and remarkable newcomer Campbell imbue irresistible charm into this moving and frequently hilarious story of two emotionally tangled people: a grieving kid thrust into adulthood and a father in over his head. Winner of a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Scrapper is a joyful comedy about family and fresh starts that believes life's not so much about chasing rainbows as snatching fistfuls in both hands.

Aspiring singer Tim has been dreaming his whole life about attending Mozart All Boys Boarding School. He is ecstatic when he is finally admitted, but his first days at the prestigious school do not turn out as expected. Facing a hostile headmaster, the stresses of first love, and struggling with the authenticity of his singing voice, Tim is intrigued to discover a wondrous secret in the old school building -- a gateway to a parallel world. He finds himself thrown into a new reality: in the role of Prince Tamino, he immerses into the cosmos of Mozart's opera, The Magic Flute, where fantasy has no limits. Now, Tim must enter the fray on two fronts, he tries to win a prominent role in the school's upcoming recital by day and returns to the magical universe where he must risk his life to free the lovely princess Pamina by night. However, living two lives takes its toll and Tim risks letting down the ones he loves. He is forced to make a decision, but has he learned enough to make the right choice?

A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke, who enters in an \"all boys\" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider. Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope. Together, their adventures in Terabithia, where they rule as king and queen, find them doing battle against the dreaded Dark Master and his monsters, trolls, ogres, and giants, while plotting revenge against the schoolyard bullies. This friendship helps Jesse cope with a tragedy that makes him realize what Leslie taught him. MPAA rating: PG. DVD, Dolby Digital Surround.
